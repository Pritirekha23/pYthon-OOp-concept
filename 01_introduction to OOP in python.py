# INTRODUCTION TO OOP CONCEPT IN PYTHON
  # Till now in our programs we have been using the procedure-oriented technique which means we have designed our program by using functions of blocks of statements and these functions are used for operations or manipulations of data.
  # This type of approach is called as procedure-oriented programming.
  # But there is another beautiful programming paradigm called object-oriented programming.

# PROGRAMMING PARADIGM:--
    # Monolithic oriented programming (in one file u have to write all the code)---> Assembly language,BASIC
    # Procedure/Structure/function  oriented programming(POP) ---> FORTAN(scientific operation),COBAL,PASCAL--(special purpose language),C(general purpose language)
    # Object-oriented programming (OOP)---> C++,Python,Java,phP etc

#INTRODUCTION TO OOP:-
    # Mechanism, Paradigm or style,Approach or technique,Principle,Guideline,Methodology 
    # OOP is principle to develope a program.
# WHAT IS OOP?
   # OOP is a programming paradigm to write program efficiently.
   # In OOP we will develop a program mainly using class and object.
   # OOP includes code reusability,scalability, and efficiency.
   # OOP is very suitable for developing large and complex applications.
   # OOP follows the DRY("Dont repeat yourself") approach.
   # In OOP, we will wrap data and function into a single unit called class.
   # Python collects object-oriented mechanishm from c++.
# ADVANTAGES OF OOP
    # Scalable
    # Reusability
    # Modularity
    # Flexibility
    # Security

# 4 principles of OOP
  # Encapsulation
  # Abstraction
  # Inheritance
  # Polymorphism
